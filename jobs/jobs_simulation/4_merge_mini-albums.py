HDF5 Album Consolidation Script

This script consolidates multiple individual HDF5 album files into a single master album file.
It processes all HDF5 files in the 'albums' directory (except the master 'album.hdf5' file)
and copies their contents into the master file with sequential event numbering.

The script maintains proper event indexing by finding the highest existing event number
in the master file and continuing the sequence from there.

Dependencies:
   - h5py: For HDF5 file operations
   - utils.my_utils: Custom utility functions for HDF5 index management

File Structure:
   albums/
   ├── album.hdf5          # Master consolidated album file (destination)
   ├── mini_album_1.hdf5   # Individual album files (sources)
   ├── mini_album_2.hdf5
   └── ...

Usage:
   Run this script from the main directory.
   The script will automatically process all HDF5 files and consolidate them.
