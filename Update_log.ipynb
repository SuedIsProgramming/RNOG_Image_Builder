    "I have started work on an improved version of RNOG which should include the ability to make images out of many different channels and stations. The exact form of the images is something to be decided, but for now, I believe I will just add a new dimension (think in the z-direction) including the different stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although testing and training is still far off, I would like to begin building infrastructure which may be of use to anyone willing to use this with machine learning. However, unlike my previous work, I would like to document and organize EVERYTHING, so that future users may use my work with ease. My program should:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be adaptable to different channels/stations.\n",
    "* Be adaptable to different bin sizes.\n",
    "* Provide \"seamless\" image creation, perhaps with a UI? It should adapt to the configuration of the stations and then build the images accordingly.\n",
    "* Save data to i3store and be able to view and \"work with\" images accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although some of these definitions are vague at the moment, I wish to sit down and think about them in the future. In every log I will (try to) include a <strong>Current work</strong>, a <strong>changelog</strong> and a <strong>TODO</strong> section to these updates. Additionally, I will include a crucial <strong style='color:#CC7722'>learning</strong> part where I will write down everything I learned during this coding experience.\n",
